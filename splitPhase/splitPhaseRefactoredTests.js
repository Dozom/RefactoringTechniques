/*
* Split phase
* 
* Motivation:
* 1. The motivation of this refactor is to split a code into separate modules.
* 2. It is useful when code is dealing with two different things.
*
* Mechanics:
* 1. Extract the second phase code into its own function.
* 2. Test.
* 3. Introduce an intermediate data structure as an additional argument to the extracted function.
* 4. Test.
* 5. Examine each parameter should not be used by the second phase. In this case, extract the results of each usage of the parameter into a field of the intermediate
* data structure and use move statements to callers on the line that populates it.
* 6. Apply extract function on the first-phase code, returning the intermediate data structure.
*
* Example:
